# Online-Voting-System using Blockchain
Blockchain technology usage for developing an E-voting system

## Brief Idea about the project
In any democratic country, Voting is a fundamental right of any citizen that enables
them to choose the leaders of tomorrow. It gives individuals in a community the facility
to voice their opinion. It helps them to realize the importance of citizenship. Online
voting systems are software platforms used to securely conduct votes and elections. As
a digital platform, they eliminate the need to cast your votes using paper or having to
gather in person. They also protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from
being able to vote multiple times.

Electronic voting or e-voting has fundamental benefits over paper based systems such 
as increased efficiency and reduced errors. The electronic voting system tends to 
maximize user participation, by allowing them to vote from anywhere and from any 
device that has an internet connection. The blockchain is an emerging, decentralized, 
and distributed technology with strong cryptographic foundations that promises to 
improve different aspects of many industries. Expanding e-voting into blockchain 
technology could be the solution to alleviate the present concerns in e-voting. Here we 
propose a blockchain-based voting system that will limit the voting fraud and make the 
voting process simple, secure and efficient.


## Work Done
Two modules are as follows:
1. Front-end for the application
2. Back-end using Solidity to implement Blockchain.
